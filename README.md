# Linux Screenshot Tool (LST)
A tool that allows for you to easily take a screenshot, without needing bloated screenshot applications

Note: Somtimes when you take a screenshot, the screen can bug out, and flash black. To fix this, just drag your cursor over the flashing parts, and retake the screenshot
