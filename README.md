# Linux Screenshot Tool (LST)
A tool that allows for you to easily take a screenshot, without needing bloated screenshot applications

Note: Somtimes when you take a screenshot, the screen can bug out, and flash black. To fix this, just drag your cursor over the flashing parts, and retake the screenshot

## Installation
Run this command in the terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/PitchBlackNights/Linux-Screenshot-Tool.git
```

Now navigate to the newly installed package (usually installed in your home directory), and run the "install.sh" file
